# dotnet-docker-clare

Aim: Dockerising an ASP.Net Core app and deploying to Heroku.

Reason: I successfully Dockerised an ASP.Net Core app following [this tutorial here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/docker/building-net-docker-images?view=aspnetcore-5.0)...

...but I was unable to get it successfully deployed to Heroku. So then I started again from scratch, using this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/getting-started/?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=windows)to create a vanilla ASP.Net Core app, and then [followed this article](https://medium.com/@vnqmai.hcmue/deploy-asp-net-core-to-heroku-for-free-using-docker-bd6d6fc161ae) to containerise it using Docker and then deploy the Docker container to Heroku.
